## Results
- Top Citi Bike Stations:

- This map indication the location the most popular Citi Bike Stations in NYC.  The size and color of the marker indicate the frequency the station is used. The majority of the larger dots are clustered in Manhattan.

- Checkout Duration:

- This line graph shows the number of bikes and duration of use.  It seems a vast majority of the bikes are used for under 20 minutes.

- Checkout Duration by Gender:

- This expands on the Checkout Duration by adding the gender of the user.  The genders seem to follow the same pattern.

- Trips by Weekday per Hour:

- This heat map shows the number of trips each day for the week by hour.  The darker color indicates a higher number of trips.  The highest number of trips during the week seem t the during the rush hours.  On the weekends, the traffic is spread out over the daylight hours.

- Trips by Weekday per Hour by Gender:

- This expands on the Trips by Weekday per Hour by adding the gender of the user.  The genders seem to follow the same pattern.

- User Trips by Gender by Weekday:

  ![User Trips by Gender by Weekday](https://github.com/jediracer/bikesharing/blob/main/images/User_Trips_by_Gender_by_Weekday.png)	
  
- This heat map indicates the number of rides each user type (Subscriber/Customer) and gender by weekday.  The darker color indicates a higher number of rides.

## Summary

- The visualizations shows a the Citi Bikes are used the most around rush hours and evenly through the weekends.  
- Gender of the riders does not seems to be factor.
- The usage of the bikes seem to be focused more densely in and around the downtown area as well as tourist locations.
- To further the analysis I would suggest 2 additional visualizations:
	- Age of Users
	- Distance of usage per rider
